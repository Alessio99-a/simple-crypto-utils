Alice wants to send Bob a secret file.

1️⃣ Generate random AES key for file (fast encryption)
2️⃣ Encrypt file with AES key (AES-256-GCM)
3️⃣ Encrypt AES key with Bob’s RSA public key (RSA-OAEP)
4️⃣ Send file + encrypted AES key to Bob

Bob receives:
1️⃣ Decrypt AES key using his RSA private key
2️⃣ Use decrypted AES key + IV + auth tag to decrypt the file
